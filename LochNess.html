                    <ol><li><strong>Where is the Loch Ness Monster Located?</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li>The loch Ness Monster has only been sighted in the Highland Council area of Scotland, in the Loch Ness.</li></ul>
                    <ol><li value="2"><strong>What does the Loch Ness Monster typically look like</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li> The loch Ness monster has had various different appearances over the years. Its first notable appearences was as a large amorphous blob that crawled across the road and into the loch. Its second appearence was as a small dog like creature with stumpy legs. Its final and most popular and most common appearance is that of a plesiosaur.</li></ul>
                    <ol><li value = "3"><strong>What is the most important Loch Ness Monster sighting?</strong> </li></ol>
                    <ul><li> Nessie is a rare Cryptid in that is has had many sightings from the day it appeared into present day. Arguably the first sighting comes from August 22 565 AD, where it was written ST Columba banished a sea creature to the bottom of the loch to prevent it from consuming the local villagers. While this maybe the first sighting, arguably the most important sighting comes from Mr and Mrs Spice in 1933. The Spices reported that as they where driving past the loch an "Extraordinary form of animal" cross the road in front of them. THey described the creature's body as nearly four feet tall and 25 feet long, that had a long "Undulating neck(of about 10 feet in length). This sighting was the first "modern" sighting and pretty much kick-started the quest to search for the creature.</li></ul>
                    <ol><li value="4"><strong>Cultural impact</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li>Of all Cryptids, with the exception of the sasquatch their most likely isn't another Cryptid as well known as the Loch Ness Monster. Countless movies, Video Games, and books have referenced or used the Loch Ness Monster within them. To this day travelers go to the loch in hopes of seeing the creature with a large part of Scotland's economy, with many businesses offering Nessie search tours.</li></ul>
                    <ol><li value="5"><strong> What does this website think?</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li> This website is of the firm belief that something unusually lives in the loch or has previously lived in the loch. This belief comes from the sheer number of reports that come in for this creature and the fact that to this day scientists are still investigating and learning new things about the loch. Fro instance in 2019 scientist used a new DNA collecting method that allowed them to better confirm what animals live in the loch. To the researchers surprise a significant amount of collected DNA turned out to be eel DNA a species previously unknown to inhabit the loch. All this leads this website to believe that it is likely that something unusual lives or has lived in the loch, admittedly it is most likely not as impressive as a plesiosaur.</li></ul>
