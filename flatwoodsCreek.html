                    <ol><li><strong>Where was the Flawoods Monster sighted?</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li>The Flatwoods Monster was cited in Flatwoods, West Virginia giving the creature its name.</li></ul>
                    <ol><li value="2"><strong>What does the Flatwoods Monster look like?</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li> The Flatwoods Monster is described as a 10-foot monster with a "blood red body" and a "green face that seemed to glow" and te creature may have had claws for hands(difficult to see because of mist). The creature also was described as not having legs instead of having a robe like lower half, and the ability to "float". In addition, the creature was accompanied by a thick sulfur smelling fog. The most distinct feature of the creature is its spade shaped head.</li></ul>
                    <ol><li value = "3"><strong>What is the most important Flatwoods Monster sighting?</strong> </li></ol>
                    <ul><li> The Flatwoods Monster only has one major sighting. The story goes that on September 12, 1952 the May brothers(Ed 13, and Freddie 12) had been playing with their friend Tommy Hyer in their Schoolyard, when they noticed a pusating red light streak across the sky and crash onto a nearby farm. Excited about something special happening the boys ran and convinced the Mays boys' mother to go with them to investigate. The party also included a few other boys, and a dog. When the group reached the crashsight they saw the pulsating red light that inspired their search. They shone their flashlights on the red light and to their horror the creature began to float in their direction. The group horrified ran off, and reported their encounter to other locals and authorites. It is important to note in the area near the creature was a sulphur smell in the air and after escaping the party felt adverse effects of Throat irritation, Vomiting, and nausea. </li></ul>
                    <ol><li value="4"><strong>Cultural impact</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li> The Story of the Flatwoods Monster has become an important part of the local folklore often being used a story passed around from one to the other. In addition the Monster does have its own museum in that of the "Flatwoods Monster Museum" </li></ul>
                    <ol><li value="5"><strong> How valid is the sighting and is there a reasonable explanation?</strong></li></ol>
                    <ul><li> It is important to note while unlike other Cryptids which have had various sightings of similar or identical creatures, the Flatwoods Monster only has one sighting. there are sightings of other creatures in the area in the days after the initial crash however this website feels that they are unrelated or unreliable. As for the Story of the Flatwoods monster it is indeed a reasonable explanation that the creature could have been an owl as besides having glowing eyes,small claws, the ability to hover,owls when threatend sometimes lower their heads and raise their wings creating a spade shape. In pop culture the monster has most recently appeared in the video game Fallout 76, the card game Metazoo, and in the legend of zelda majoras mask has an enemy that appears to be based off of it.</li></ul>
